# Agent Workflow Contract

This document is the P6.3.1 default operating contract for agents using Yunti
Browser Runtime. It is intentionally tool-level and LLM-agnostic: Yunti stays
the browser operation layer, while the agent remains responsible for task
planning and user judgment.

## Default Loop

Use this loop for normal page work:

1. Call `yunti_get_tool_usage_hints` when the tool contract is uncertain.
2. Call `yunti_list_browser_targets` and choose the intended page
   `browserSessionId`, or its `tabId` / `targetId` when not registered.
3. Call `yunti_observe_page` for the current page state.
4. Act with a fresh uid when possible.
5. If the page is loading or changing, call `yunti_wait_for`.
6. After every wait or action, call `yunti_observe_page` again.
7. Verify the result using observe, snapshot, evaluate, screenshot, network, or
   console tools before assuming the task is done.
8. If an operation fails, read `retryable`, `retryBudget`, `recoveryAction`,
   and `resultUncertain`. Retry only when explicitly allowed by the shared budget.

## Recovery Rules

- Stale route: discard the stale id, list targets once, and spend the single
  allowed retry on the selected live page route.
- Protocol mismatch: `YUNTI_EXTENSION_PROTOCOL_MISMATCH` has `retryBudget=0`.
  Reload the current extension and run doctor; do not probe with other tools.
- Multiple browsers: use `browserInstanceId`, `browserFamily`, and
  `routeBrowserSessionId` from target inventory. An ambiguous tab id is not
  retryable until the intended browser instance is selected.
- Edge sleeping tab: `0.2.4+` bounds content-script recovery and may briefly
  activate the target tab before restoring the user's previous tab. Do not ask
  the user to switch, refresh, or reopen the page unless this automatic recovery
  has failed because browser access is explicitly blocked.
- Extension-side timeout: the controller poll remains independent from the
  timed-out page operation. Treat the result as uncertain and verify page state
  before deciding whether another call is safe.
- Stale uid: call `yunti_observe_page` again and use a fresh uid.
- Async UI: call `yunti_wait_for`, then `yunti_observe_page`, then continue
  with a fresh uid.
- Scroll uncertainty: prefer fresh `scrollableContainers[]` uids, inspect
  `moved`, `edgeHint`, `partialMovement`, and `recoveryHint`.
- Fill/select uncertainty: inspect `fillable`, `readOnly`, `disabled`,
  `fillBlockReason`, `selectedValue`, `selectedText`, and `options[]` before
  retrying.
- Timeout: treat `WAIT_TIMEOUT` as a signal to observe and adjust the condition,
  not proof that the user task failed.
- Coordinates/selectors: use them as recovery or debugging paths when fresh
  uids are unavailable.

## Execution Backend

- Content-script actions and CDP are complementary first-class backends. Choose
  the path that can operate and verify the current page most reliably.
- Use CDP proactively for cross-origin frames, shadow DOM, canvas, precise input,
  browser targets, network control, emulation, tracing, or unreliable DOM paths.
- Chrome may show a debugger banner while CDP is attached. The banner is
  informational and is not a reason to avoid CDP.
- CDP use does not require user confirmation by itself. Confirmation depends on
  the effect of the action, such as submitting, deleting, purchasing, or
  changing production data.
- Do not blindly replay a possibly completed write action through another
  backend. Observe or inspect page state first when execution is uncertain.

## Confirmation Boundary

Ask the user for explicit confirmation before:

- submitting forms that change production data;
- deleting, approving, purchasing, publishing, or sending messages;
- uploading sensitive files;
- exposing or copying secrets, credentials, cookies, auth headers, tokens, or
  private keys;
- taking an action whose effect cannot be verified from page state.

## Copyable Prompt

```text
Please operate my browser through Yunti Browser Runtime.

Follow this workflow:
1. Call yunti_get_tool_usage_hints if tool usage is uncertain.
2. Call yunti_list_browser_targets and choose the intended page browserSessionId or tabId/targetId.
3. Use yunti_observe_page before page actions.
4. Prefer fresh uids from yunti_observe_page for click, hover, fill, select,
   scroll, type, press, upload, and drag operations.
5. After each action, verify by observing again or using snapshot, evaluate,
   screenshot, network, or console tools.
6. For async rendering, validation, navigation, option loading, or infinite
   scroll, call yunti_wait_for, then yunti_observe_page, then continue with a
   fresh uid.
7. If a result has ok=false, code, recoveryHint, or nextStepHint, follow that
   guidance before retrying. Do not blindly repeat the same action.
8. Use selector or coordinate fallback only when fresh uids are unavailable or
   as an explicit recovery/debugging path.
9. Let Yunti recover stale routes and Edge sleeping tabs automatically. Do not
   ask me to refresh, switch tabs, or restart the browser before controller and
   tabId/targetId recovery have failed.
10. Use content-script actions or CDP according to which backend can complete and
   verify the task most reliably. CDP is not a restricted fallback.
11. Before submitting, deleting, approving, purchasing, publishing, uploading
   sensitive files, or changing production data, ask me for confirmation.
12. Do not expose raw cookies, passwords, auth headers, tokens, private keys, or
   other secrets. Remember that DOM observation redaction does not redact
   screenshots.

## Minimal Use Case Index

The concrete P6.3.2 minimal use cases are maintained in
[Tool Guide](TOOL_GUIDE.md#minimal-use-cases) and mirrored in the packaged
skill:

- Click
- Fill Form
- Scroll To Find
- Switch Tab
- Wait For Async Result

## Non-Goals

- Do not move a built-in LLM loop into Yunti Runtime.
- Do not replace fine-grained `yunti_*` tools with a single opaque task runner.
- Do not require a mandatory hub tab or side panel for the default local path.
- Do not remove CDP, screenshots, network, console, tab control, upload, or
  diagnostic capabilities while improving page-level workflows.
